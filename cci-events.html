      <p>As our first project, we decided to build a bomb the size of Russia under the I.S. 2 Intermediate School. We started
        construction right across the street of where the main entrance to the school was. We used most of our resources and 
        <s>child</s> workers to launch the event right as the school year for I.S. 2 was about to end, which was
        about 3 months. It was close, but after 3 months of hard work <s>our workers</s> we completed the project with one day left
        to spare. Finally on the 26th of June we launched the event and successfully blew up the school. Here is the real
        <a class="event-footage-link" target="_blank" href="/videos/unedited_real_is2_event.mp4"> <strong>UNEDITED</strong> footage</a> of the event happening! This event was celebrated 
        by our company and will be one of our best moments in this company's history and we hope to continue to make more events like
        these as our comapany grows.

      <p>After more than 2 months of the I.S. 2 explotion event we have decided on a new event! On September 7th, 2023, our great
        CEO saw the potential for a surprise for New Dorp High School. We have decided that this event will be different from
        our first one, we want it to be bigger and better, along with some other new things. Currently we&#39;re on 1 step.
        &#8226;Step 1&#58; Plan the event
